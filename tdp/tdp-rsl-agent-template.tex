\section{Very Important Note}%% Remove this section when starting to work on the template.
This year we have some changes in TDP's structure. Each teams should obey the new structure. In the TDP, Teams should use significant worth references. 

In Section 2 your works on several modules should be described with these sub-parts "1-summary of related scientific papers about the problems about this module, 2-What other teams did last year(not only what they said on TDP),3-what is your approach,4-provide their cons and props".

Be care about plagiarism, if a team commits plagiarism, the team and its members will be banned participating on the current and next year's RoboCup Rescue Simulation competitions. The term plagiarism comprises any use of external knowledge without proper referencing, i.e., copying or using thoughts, ideas, texts or language in general and presenting them as their own. This applies for Team Description Papers as well as team code. All kinds of licenses and copyright have to be respected. This applies to the qualification process and the RoboCup tournaments. Please be aware that when a team is found guilty of committing plagiarism it is disqualified and banned at any time. This may also be in the middle of the tournament.

You can use command \cite{ref1} for citing an article. Please put the  BibTeX of the reference in references.bib.


\section{Introduction}
%%
The introduction should highlight the main issues approached by the team. The
team should provide a brief overview of these issues and highlight other
approaches to solve them. It is also extremely important to describe the main
improvements made by the team since last year, if the team participated
previously in the RoboCup Rescue Agent competition.
